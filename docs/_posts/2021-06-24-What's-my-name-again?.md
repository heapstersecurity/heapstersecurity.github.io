OK... HeapsterSecurity is the name of this blog, but why?

Since this is the first post here, I thought it would be a good idea to explain why it's called like this and what to expect to find here.

First things first: Hi! I'm @sartorum and welcome to HeapsterSecurity. I've been a software security analyst since 2016 and am on my way to get the OSCP certification.

For me, the most difficult things to come up with are names. When I play any kind of RPG, usually I always use the same name: Manaba, my old druid from World of Warcraft or my most recent handle on social media, Sartorum. Not much creative.

 I was then talking with a good friend of mine (also, make sure to check out his blog as well: [https://mdanilor.github.io/](https://mdanilor.github.io/) - there you can find some interesting low level security stuff) and said I was thinking to create a blog, but I didn't know how to name it. That was when he suggested to me: "Look... you'll talk about infosec and you are a hipster - try something like HeapsterSecurity!" - so here it is! Kudos to mdanilor!

But why a hipster? Well, some people like to say I am one just because my music taste that goes from Billie Eilish to folk-metal Mongolian throat singing bands (if you don't know, go check out [The Hu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4xZUr0BEfE), not to be confused with The Who).

Then changing hipster to Heapster was just a pun due to the material you will likely find here. I still don't know how mdanilor was able to find so fast a computing component (like the heap) that matched so well with the word hipster.

Feel free to reach out to me:
